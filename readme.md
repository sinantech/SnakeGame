## Setup

First, ensure you have a Java development environment set up. You will need the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Project Structure

Create a new Java project and add the following classes:

1. `GameFrame`
2. `GamePanel`
3. `MyKeyAdapter`

## GameFrame Class

This class will set up the main window for the game.

## GamePanel Class

This class will contain the game logic, including rendering the game and handling the snake's movement.

## Main Class

Finally, create a main class to run the game.

## Running the Game

1. Compile the project.
2. Run the `SnakeGame` class.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.

## Summary

You've created a basic Snake game using Java Swing. This example demonstrates essential game development concepts such as handling user input, rendering graphics, and game logic. Feel free to enhance and expand the game with additional features like scoring, levels, and sound effects.
